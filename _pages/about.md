I'm a graduate Aerospace Engineer with a diverse skill-set and passion for all things tech. Before embarking on a masters in Berlin I'm searching for internship positions to consolidate my skill-set.

Moving on from a bachelors degree I've attained many computational based skills that I'd like to showcase along side  an exhibition of experience I've attained to this point in my career (including notable achievements external to academia).

Navigate through some of the different engineering projects I've carried out above, as well as some key milestones with regards to volunteering projects, music and football.

Linkedin, github and contact details on the side-bar for any inquiries.
