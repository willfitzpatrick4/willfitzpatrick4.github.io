I'm a graduate Aerospace Engineer with a diverse skill-set and passion for all things tech. Over the past year I've reapplied my analytical skill-set towards various projects associated with data.

Moving on from a bachelors degree I've built this portfolio to exhibit my most notable engineering projects to date as well as data science projects I've carried out this year.

Navigate through the various projects above. Linkedin, github and contact details are on the side-bar for any inquiries.
