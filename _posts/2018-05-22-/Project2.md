# Aims and Objectives

The principle objective of this experiment was to discern the overall performance levels of an AMT Olympus turbojet engine. This was achieved through analysing the performance and component efficiencies at various stages corresponding to phases in a typical jet cycle. These results were juxtaposed with those of typical larger scale gas turbine engines.

The test procedure was carried out in a way that would test the engine at various conditions, namely: idle power, approach power, climb power and take off/go around power.

The equipment was initialised from an engine cold-start. During the first run, communication on what throttle percentages were to be targeted for each increment in ‘phase’ of flight. The ‘Test and Data Recording’ for the cold start was the same as the hot start procedure, except no test was carried out before the cold start, in addition, throttle increments were random due to the communication issue. This did not have a major impact on the results, albeit the ‘phases’ of flight were not consistent with a hot engine start.
