# How Does It Work?

There exist six main types of jet engine. The image above depicts a turbofan, employed mainly for commercial use based on its optimal efficiency levels between a Mach number of 0.8 and 0.9. A turbofan operates almost identically to a turbojet but with a portion of the air partitioned from the inlet. In essence, a turbofan emits a large amount of air more slowly, whereas a turbojet emits a smaller amount of air quickly, leading to knock down effect on the efficiency of the aircraft.

The components of a gas turbine engine work sequentially with each other to generate thrust. The components include the inlet, the compressor, the combustion chamber, the turbine, and the nozzle. Each stage of the engine is engineered specifically to maximise the thrust output from the engine.

The process is commenced firstly with air intake through the inlet. The inlet is designed to maximise the volume of air admitted into the engine whilst ensuring directionally smooth airflow into the compressor. As the name indicates, the next stage is designed to compress the air taken in through the inlet, thereby increasing the pressure through reducing the volume to a fraction of its initial value (resulting in an increase in internal energy). The compressor is perpetually spinning due to energy transfers from the turbine to the central shaft later in the process

As compressed air leaves the compressor it is mixed with fuel and ignited in the combustor, the internal energy of the compressed air, as well as the energy gain from the combustion process, both contribute to a vast gain in energy in the overall system. The products of the reaction are then exhausted through the combustion chamber and into the turbine.

In the first stage, the rotation of the turbine is largely down to the impact of the high energy products of the combustion, hence is often referred to as an impulse turbine. Energy is transferred to the central shaft by a momentum transfer that mirrors the energy transfer in the compressor but in reverse. The shaft power harnessed by the turbine is employed to rotate the compressor.



## Aims and Objectives

TO build a  principle objective of this experiment was to discern the overall performance levels of an AMT Olympus turbojet engine. This was achieved through analysing the performance and component efficiencies at various stages corresponding to phases in a typical jet cycle. These results were juxtaposed with those of typical larger scale gas turbine engines.

The test procedure was carried out in a way that would test the engine at various conditions, namely: idle power, approach power, climb power and take off/go around power.

The equipment was initialised from an engine cold-start. During the first run, communication on what throttle percentages were to be targeted for each increment in ‘phase’ of flight. The ‘Test and Data Recording’ for the cold start was the same as the hot start procedure, except no test was carried out before the cold start, in addition, throttle increments were random due to the communication issue. This did not have a major impact on the results, albeit the ‘phases’ of flight were not consistent with a hot engine start.
