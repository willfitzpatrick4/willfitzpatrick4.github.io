# How Does It Work?

There are a number of different types of jet engine, but since we are considering economic and environmental impacts, the most appropriate type of jet engine to consider ,therefore, is the turbofan, pictured below, as it is the most widely used in commercial airliners, which make up the majority of airplanes that are flown on a regular basis (Benson 2014 Engines).  The engines considered here are thus turbofans.

The components of a gas turbine engine work sequentially with each other to generate thrust. The main components include: the compressor, the combustion chamber, the turbine, and the nozzle. Each stage of the engine is engineered specifically to maximise the thrust output from the engine.

The process is commenced with air intake through the inlet at the front of the engine by spinning the rotors, composed of many short propeller blades in the compressor (Benson 2014 Engines). Due to the shape of the compressor and the speed of the spinning rotors, and therefore the incoming air, all of the incoming air is compressed, increasing pressure to several times the pressure at which it entered the engine, as it passes through the compressor (Benson 2014 Engines). As compressed air leaves the compressor it is mixed with fuel and ignited in the combustor, causing an explosion and a vast increase in temperature and thereby pressure, resulting in the air-fuel mixture expanding rapidly out of the combustor and through the turbine (Benson 2014 Engines). As the air-fuel mixture, or exhaust gas, forces its way out of the rear of the engine it passes through the turbine, composed of many rotors again, causing it to spin (Benson 2014 Engines). The rotors in this case differ from those in the compressor in that they harness the energy of the expanding exhaust gas, as opposed to using energy to suck air into the engine (Benson 2014 Engines).

## Aims and Objectives

The principle objective of this experiment was to discern the overall performance levels of an AMT Olympus turbojet engine. This was achieved through analysing the performance and component efficiencies at various stages corresponding to phases in a typical jet cycle. These results were juxtaposed with those of typical larger scale gas turbine engines.

The test procedure was carried out in a way that would test the engine at various conditions, namely: idle power, approach power, climb power and take off/go around power.

The equipment was initialised from an engine cold-start. During the first run, communication on what throttle percentages were to be targeted for each increment in ‘phase’ of flight. The ‘Test and Data Recording’ for the cold start was the same as the hot start procedure, except no test was carried out before the cold start, in addition, throttle increments were random due to the communication issue. This did not have a major impact on the results, albeit the ‘phases’ of flight were not consistent with a hot engine start.
