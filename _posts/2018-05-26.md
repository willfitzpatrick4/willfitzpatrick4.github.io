# The Manufacturing and Testing of a SHOCK TEST FACILITY

A project that revolves itself around the investigation and characterisation of shock
phenomena in specific engineering scenarios. The scenarios under consideration are
contained very prominently within spacecraft and aerospace industries. During the launch/
flight sequence of an aircraft, there exists a multitude of flight stages in which pyrotechnic
shock is generated.

These particular forms of shock hold the capacity to completely
dismantle the success of missions. This is achieved through many means. The high
frequency propagation associated with pyrotechnic shock has been known to abolish the
functionality of imperative flight equipment within the payload. Consequentially, pyrotechnic
shock is of extremely high significance. Discerning a comprehensive understanding of
pyrotechnic shock for companies has become a fundamental priority in both mitigating
against its inherently destructive nature and attaining the ability to shock test equipment,
ensuring their proficiency in withstanding flight conditions.
