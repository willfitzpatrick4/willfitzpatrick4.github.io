# The Manufacturing and Testing of a SHOCK TEST FACILITY

A project that revolves itself around the investigation and characterisation of shock
phenomena in specific engineering scenarios. The scenarios under consideration are
contained very prominently within spacecraft and aerospace industries. During the launch/
flight sequence of an aircraft, there exists a multitude of flight stages in which pyrotechnic
shock is generated.

These particular forms of shock hold the capacity to completely dismantle the success of missions. The high frequency propagation excitation associated with pyrotechnic shock has been known to abolish the functionality of imperative flight equipment within the payload of spacecraft. Consequentially, discerning a comprehensive understanding of pyrotechnic shock for companies has become a fundamental priority in both mitigating against its inherently destructive nature and attaining the ability to shock test equipment, ensuring their proficiency in withstanding flight conditions.

## The Finalised Design

An extensive literature review, partnered with assistance from the PHD supervisor allocated to this particular project, helped for the construction of the design to the most optimised experimental procedure (with consideration to the projects scope).

The procedure was designed as a form of Point Pyroshock Source Simulator with a tuned resonant fixture
attached to a base plate (fixed to a rack). The pyrotechnic shock simulation technique utilises the excitation capabilities of the Single state gas gun.

A cylindrical steel projectile (depicted below) would be fired at a pre-determined velocity
controlled by the Single state gas gun bar. From this point the Dynamic loading response
would be recorded from 2 accelerometers at equidistance from the point source.

### Experimental Results

In carrying out the experimental procedure, three fundamental parameters relating to the
acceleration response were outlined as variables. Using these three parameters an
experimental procedure was constructed to provide an effective analysis of the acceleration
response for the pyrotechnic simulation technique. The three parameters investigated in the
numerical simulations were adjusted to fine tune the SRS slope to the required test levels,
these include:

- The configuration/position of the accelerometers
- The material of the projectile impacting the resonator
- The velocity of the projectile impacting the resonator

In investigating the effect of each of the parameters, all the other parameters were kept
constant and the parameter under analysis was altered incrementally. The configuration of
the accelerometers was varied through three different locations. On the LHS the accelerometer is attached to the tip of the response plate. On the RHS the accelerometer is attached directly to the aluminium sheet.

The experimental procedure was made up of a number of sequential stages. After the
apparatus was bolted to the rack in the experimental room, the gas gun was loaded with a
projectile and a response plate was attached to the first configuration position he room of
the gas gun was exited by the technician, student and project officer. The mesh door
inclosing the gun and apparatus was locked, ensuring all personal were protected from
ricochet of the bullet. The DAQ software was set to record and the recording software
connected to the barrel of the gas gun was readied.

The pressure valves on the Hopkins pressure bar controller were set by the technician, the pressure values were varied
depending on the velocity required for the excitation. The projectile was then fired and the
shock response acquired from the accelerometer. With each accelerometer configuration the velocity was varied at three increments. Each velocity increment was repeated to ensure errors in the experiment were bypassed. After data was
acquired for each velocity increment the material of the bullet was altered from plastic to
steel (or visa-versa) and the process was repeated.
