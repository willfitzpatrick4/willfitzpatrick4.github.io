# The Manufacturing and Testing of a SHOCK TEST FACILITY

A project that revolves itself around the investigation and characterisation of shock
phenomena in specific engineering scenarios. The scenarios under consideration are
contained very prominently within spacecraft and aerospace industries. During the launch/
flight sequence of an aircraft, there exists a multitude of flight stages in which pyrotechnic
shock is generated.

These particular forms of shock hold the capacity to completely dismantle the success of missions. The high frequency propagation excitation associated with pyrotechnic shock has been known to abolish the functionality of imperative flight equipment within the payload of spacecraft. Consequentially, discerning a comprehensive understanding of pyrotechnic shock for companies has become a fundamental priority in both mitigating against its inherently destructive nature and attaining the ability to shock test equipment, ensuring their proficiency in withstanding flight conditions.

## The Finalised Design

An extensive literature review, partnered with assistance from the PHD supervisor allocated to this particular project, helped for the construction of the design to the most optimised experimental procedure (with consideration to the projects scope).

The procedure was designed as a form of Point Pyroshock Source Simulator with a tuned resonant fixture
attached to a base plate (fixed to a rack). The pyrotechnic shock simulation technique utilises the projectile capabilities contained within the Single state gas gun.

A cylindrical steel projectile (depicted below) would be fired at a pre-determined velocity
controlled by the Single state gas gun bar. From this point the Dynamic loading response
would be recorded from 2 accelerometers at equidistance from the point source.
